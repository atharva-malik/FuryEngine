The human experience, and by extension, relationships are shaped by connection, yet the nature and resilience of these bonds are perpetually attenuated by the societal frameworks in which the exist. Both John Lanchester's dystopian novel "The Wall" and James McTeigue's film "V for Vendetta" explore how totalitarian societal structures exert profound impacts on human relationships. While "The Wall" depicts a future where constant structural segregation and existential dread dictate interactions within a brutally enforced border, "V for Vendetta" illustrates how a hegemonic regime crushes individuality, thereby distorting and killing human connections and relationships. Despite their vastly different settings and mediums, both works converge on the idea that relationships, whether familial, romantic, or communal, are vulnerable to the weight of an authoritarian society, which can result in individuals being forced into roles of compliance or rebellion.

In "The Wall," the pervasive trepidation of the 'Others' along with the constant threat of the unknown outer world, along with a rigid hierarchy are the main societal forces shaping relationships. The novel's central metaphor, the Wall, physically and psychologically isolates the inhabitants, creating a sense of desperate survival, where the inhabitants thoughts are limited to the immediate and the mundane. This feeling, coupled with the omnipresent threat of violence from the 'Others,' permeates all interactions and is most evident in the strained and instrumental nature of familial bonds. Kavanagh, the protagonist, experiences a detached and fragmented relationship with his parents, even stating that "None of us can talk to our parents." Their interactions are charaterised by terse exchanges and tacit anxieties, "We don’t talk much and both prefer it that way," hinting at a society where emotional intimacy is a luxury that cannot be afforded. The formal, almost ritualistic goodbyes, "When I left on the return journey, walk bus train another train lorry, I said goodbye to my mother and father at the front door. A shy hug from my mother, and a handshake from my dad," the protagonist experiences only further highlight the profound emotional disjuncture; there is no warmth, only the acceptance of fate. Lanchester's minimalist focus on Kavanagh's internal monologue effectively conveys the lack of emotional depth. The paucity of dialogue between him and his family members, for example, suggests a society where profound communication is discouraged, and instead replaced by a rigid adherence to protocol.
Similarly, "V for Vendetta" protrays a society where the Norsefire regime's totalitarian grip on the population severely compromises human connections through constant surveillance, propaganda, and enforced conformity. The government actively fosters an environment of fear, suspicion, and betrayal, exemplified by the cold music of the starting scene, where Evey Hammond is nearly assaulted by government agents, only to be saved by the "dramatis" V. Relationships are often predicated on fear, as people learn to conceal their true thoughts and feelings. Evey Hammond's initial fear-driven compliance, even towards those she seemingly cares about, epitomises this. Her relationship with Gordon Deitrich is brutally shattered, in the scene of Gordon's swift and savage arrest, by the regime's violent retaliation against Gordon's subversive actions. This incident serves as a warning that even rich and famous people are not immune to the state's encroachment. McTeigue's use of sharp cuts and loud, tense music during scenes of government raids visually reinforces the sudden and violent rupture of personal spaces, emphasising how easily a person's apparent safety can be annihilated. The omnipresent surveillance, symbolised by the "Eye" and "Ear", further engenders paranoia, preventing the formation of deep relationships essential for human flourishing.

However, both works also demonstrate how the very oppressiveness that seeks to destroy human connection can become a catalyst for its re-evaluation, and, in the case of "V for Vendetta," its genesis. In "The Wall," Kavanagh's relationships with the 'Defenders' and later with Hifa evolve amidst the brutal conditions. The shared hardship and constant threat forge a raw, primal form of solidarity among the Defenders, as shown in "my Wall company was what I had in my life now, instead of family and friends." They rely on each other for survival, and while not deeply emotional in a sense, their interdependence builds a powerful bond. Kavanagh's relationship with Hifa, "Do you want to Breed with me?", was initially a transactional arrangement for survival, deepens later into something resembling love and mutual respect as they navigate the desolate existence outside the Wall. Lanchester uses the harsh nature of their environment to highlight the emergence of genuine connection - not love, not in the traditional sense at least, but a profound interdependence. The novel's use of Kavanagh's first-person perspective allows for an intimate portrayal of his shifting perceptions, "I wanted to be with Hifa," revealing how the desperate need for human contact can transcend the ingrained fear and isolation perpetuated by the Wall.
In "V for Vendetta," the oppressive regime directly precipitates the transformative bond between V and Evey. V, through his extreme and terrifying methods, as shown in the scenes of Evey's imprisonment, systematically divests Evey of her fear, forcing her to confront the true nature of her world. Their relationship, initially of captor and unwilling protégé, shown in "I had nothing to do with the Bailey, and I made a terrible mistake in the Drondau," evolves into a symbiotic partnership built on shared ideology and mutual respect, shown in "We could leave here together." This transformation is pivotal; Evey learns to trust V, not merely as a person, but as the embodiment of an idea. Filmic techniques such as the stark lighting and close-up shots during Evey's imprisonment emphasise her vulnerability and subsequent resilience, while V's constant philosophical pronouncements, delivered through powerful voice overs like Valerie's: "I know there's no way...you. -Valerie," elucidate the ideals that bind them. Their connection transcends mere personal affection, becoming a potent emblem of hop and resistance for a society starved of genuine human interaction.

In summation, both "The Wall" and "V for Vendetta" argue that while the oppressive societal structures are designed to control and fragment human connections, they cannot entirely kill the human need for them. Lanchester's "The Wall" suggest a more pessimistic outlook, where relationships are primarily forged out of necessity and a shared struggle against an inescapable fate, often lacking emotional depth. The ending, with Kavanagh and Hifa enduring outside the Wall, signifies a form of survival based on mutual dependence. In contrast, "V for Vendetta" offers a more optimistic vision, where the radical resistance leads to, not only the mending of fractured relationships, but also inspiring a collective uprising for freedom. Evey's final act of pulling the lever, leading to the blowing up of the parliament, epitomises the idea that human connection, when aligned with a greater cause, possesses the power to dismantle even the most entrenched systems of oppression. Through their distinct yet convergin narratives, both texts underscore the enduring vulnerability and surprising resilience of human relationships when confronted by the overwhelming force of the state.
